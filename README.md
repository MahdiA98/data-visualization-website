## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>
This project was built as part of my assignment in the 'Advanced Web Development with Big Data' module. Project goals included developing a website in the cloud, as opposed to servers, using AWS and introduce new concepts such as WebSockets and Sentiment Analysis.

Numerical data was gathered using online web services. For this project, I made use of [API-Football](https://www.api-football.com/). Data for the sentiment anaylsis was collected via the Twitter API, creating a developer account and retrieving tweets surrounding BPL teams. These were stored within the AWS cloud using DynamoDB as the database.

AWS Comprehend used for sentiment analysis of Twitter data.

Back-end functionalities and data processing implemented using AWS Lambda functions.

Front-end files were uploaded into S3 buckets and hosted within the cloud.
